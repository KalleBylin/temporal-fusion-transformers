## Description

The focus of this project is to better understand how we can deal with high-dimensional time series with multiple inputs, missing values and irregular timestamps. In this situation, the performance of the classical approaches is not satisfying, and na√Øve applications of deep learning also fail. Even the deep learning models that have shown promising results tend to "black boxes" with little insight into how to interpret the results.

## Goals

- Discover interplay between classical approaches of time series prediction and modern deep learning techniques.   
- Reproduce the model in paper "Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting" by Bryan Lim, Sercan Arik, Nicolas Loeff and Tomas Pfister.
- Test the model on generated data and compare my results on datasets used by the authors in the paper.
